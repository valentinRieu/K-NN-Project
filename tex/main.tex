% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)

% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

	\begin{abstract}
		This article describes methods of data reduction and calculation optimization applied to a \ac{KNN} machine learning algorithm. Data reduction methods help reducing the complexity by reducing the training data, while preserving as much as is achievable the accuracy of the model. Calculation optimization methods accelerate the prediction process of the \ac{KNN} model.

	You can have as much text here as you want. The main body must be at most $8$ pages long.
	For the final version, one more page can be added.
	If you want, you can use an appendix like this one, even using the one-column format.

% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022. 
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
